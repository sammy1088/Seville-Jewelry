I started making jewelry as a hobby 8 years ago, which fortunately for me has turned into a great business! I started Seville Jewelry and beautiful handcrafted jewelry- that expresses who you are and makes a statement. Hopefully it will touch your soul and lift your spirit as much as it does for me when I create!

My pieces are one of a kind and are ready for shipping. If you are looking for something style/color in particular and aren't finding it...contact me.

I hope that you enjoy looking through my shop.
